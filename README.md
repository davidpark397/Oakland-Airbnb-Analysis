# Oakland-Airbnb-Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains the versions of data, figures generated, and Python notebook that comprise an analysis of 3000+ Airbnb listings in the city of Oakland. In my experience, I've been very confused as to what determines the price of an Airbnb. When I needed to get an Airbnb in Chicago during an internship, for example, very similar listings (according to my specifications) in the neighborhood that I wanted to stay in displayed large variations in price. The analysis featured here represents an attempt at better understanding the drivers of the price of an airbnb listing as a product of its characteristics. We first clean the data, perform an extensive EDA, and then use regularized regression models to predict price and perform a basic feature importance analysis. 

## Data
The data used in this analysis consists of Airbnb listings characteristics for the city of Oakland, CA from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html compiled on July 8, 2019.
