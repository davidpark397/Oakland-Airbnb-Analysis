# Oakland-Airbnb-Analysis
The data that I will be using for this analysis consists of Airbnb listings characteristics for the city of Oakland, CA from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html compiled on July 8, 2019.

The analyses produced will mostly be for the purpose of understanding the drivers of an Oakland Airbnb listing's price. We will start off by analyzing and visualizing basic trends in the data. Once we have gained a general idea of how price is affected across numerous different factors, regularized linear models will be applied in order to predict price itself.
